When it's your time.God has a tendency of picking up a `nobody`, to become `somebody`, in front of `everybody`, without consulting `anybody`. 

Your `Destiny` is not tied to the people who `walk away` from you.

When `CONDITION` knock you down, try to fall on your back, because if you can `LOOK UP` you can `RISE UP`.
