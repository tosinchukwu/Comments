# What every man needs to know>>>

1. On our way to `MIRACLE`, we need somebody that shall `PROVOKE` us to do something we did not `PLAN` to do. 
```
1 Samuel 1 : 6 -20
```
2. Any man on `EARTH` without a `PROBLEM` is a `PROBLEM` to the `EARTH`

3. `Progress` in life demands `Vision`, `Consistency` and `Hardworking`.

4. If you don't pass through `ANYTHING` in life, you cannot be `ANYTHING` in life.
```
1 Samuel 17 : 34 -37
```
5. the `BRERAKFAST` of `CHAMPIONS` is not `TEA` but `PROBLEMS` (to settle)
```
1 Samuel 17 :26
```
Your `DESTINY` is not tied to the people who `walk away` from you.
