Little drops of water makes a might Ocean

Good things comes to those that patiently wait for it

Givers never lack

In a great man's house, there are many vessels

In all you do acknowledge God always

Progress in life demands Vision, Consistency and Hardworking.

The Happiest time of a farmer is the time of Harvest.

Joy is coming

God can do it again. And again, and again 

No body can fight against God the Creator

It takes Grace to win the Race
